    <h1>My Tech Journey: Finally Taking DSA Seriously</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        You know that one thing every experienced developer keeps telling you to learn, and you keep nodding like 
        “Yeah, yeah, I’ll get to it” — but never actually do? For me, that was Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). 
        I had danced around it for years, but this time, I decided to stop procrastinating and really commit. 
        Spoiler: It’s not as scary as I thought… but it’s also not as easy as I hoped.
    </p>

    <h2>The Decision</h2>
    <p>
        My wake-up call came during a coding interview prep session. I realized I could build projects and solve real-world problems, 
        but when asked to implement a “binary search” from scratch, I suddenly became an ancient Greek philosopher — 
        answering questions with more questions. That’s when I knew: time to face the DSA beast head-on.
    </p>

    <h2>The First Few Weeks</h2>
    <p>
        I started with arrays and linked lists, thinking, “How hard can this be?” Turns out, harder than I expected. 
        I had to rewire my brain to think in terms of memory, complexity, and efficiency — not just “will it work?”.
    </p>
    <p>
        My early practice sessions were a mix of small wins (finally understanding how a stack works) 
        and humbling defeats (trying to implement quicksort without crying). 
        The important thing? I kept showing up, problem after problem.
    </p>

    <h2>Breakthrough Moments</h2>
    <p>
        One magical moment was solving my first graph traversal problem. 
        I still remember the “aha!” feeling when my BFS code finally returned the correct output — 
        and didn’t take a million years to run.
    </p>
    <p>
        The more I practiced, the more patterns I started to see. 
        Problems that once felt like puzzles from another dimension started to look… familiar.
    </p>

    <h2>Lessons from DSA</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Consistency beats intensity:</strong> Solving 2–3 problems every day adds up fast.</li>
        <li><strong>Understand, don’t memorize:</strong> If you can explain a concept without looking at code, you’ve truly learned it.</li>
        <li><strong>Track your progress:</strong> Watching your “solved” count go up is surprisingly motivating.</li>
        <li><strong>Take breaks:</strong> Brute-forcing your brain rarely works; sometimes the solution hits you in the shower.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What’s Next?</h2>
    <p>
        My plan is to tackle more advanced topics — dynamic programming, heaps, and maybe even segment trees 
        (which currently sound like something from a fantasy novel). 
        I also want to mix DSA with real-world projects so it doesn’t feel like I’m solving problems in a vacuum.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        Taking DSA seriously has been humbling, frustrating, and incredibly rewarding. 
        If you’ve been avoiding it like I did, here’s your sign to just start. 
        The first few steps will feel slow, but one day you’ll look back and realize you’re solving problems 
        you once thought were impossible. And that’s a pretty great feeling.
