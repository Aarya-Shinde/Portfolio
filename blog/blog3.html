    <h1>My Tech Journey: Learning Git & GitHub Without Losing My Mind</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        If I had a rupee for every time someone told me “Use Git!”, I could probably fund my own startup by now. 
        But I’ll admit it — for a long time, I avoided it. Git felt like one of those mysterious developer tools 
        you *pretend* to know about until someone asks you to explain <code>git rebase</code>. 
        Eventually, I decided enough was enough — time to actually learn it.
    </p>

    <h2>Why Git & GitHub?</h2>
    <p>
        In simple terms, Git is a version control system — a fancy way of saying 
        “it remembers all your code changes so you can go back in time when you mess up.”  
        GitHub is like Git’s social media — a place to store, share, and collaborate on code with others.
    </p>
    <p>
        Before Git, I had folders named <em>project_final</em>, <em>project_final_v2</em>, and 
        <em>project_final_FINAL_REALLY_THIS_ONE</em>. Now, Git keeps my history clean and my sanity intact.
    </p>

    <h2>First Steps</h2>
    <p>
        I started small — just creating a local repository and making a few commits. 
        The first commands I learned became my everyday toolkit:
    </p>
<pre>
# Initialize a Git repo
git init

# Check file status
git status

# Add changes
git add filename.txt

# Commit changes with a message
git commit -m "Initial commit"
</pre>
    <p>
        Seeing those commits pile up felt strangely satisfying. 
        Like I was giving my code a personal diary.
    </p>

    <h2>Pushing to GitHub</h2>
    <p>
        Once I got the basics, I linked my local repo to a GitHub repository. That’s when I started feeling like 
        a “real developer.” Here’s what the magic looked like:
    </p>
<pre>
# Connect local repo to GitHub
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repo-name.git

# Push code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
</pre>
    <p>
        Suddenly, my code was on the internet — versioned, safe, and ready to share.
    </p>

    <h2>Branching & Merging</h2>
    <p>
        Branches quickly became my favorite feature. 
        They let me experiment with new features without breaking my main code.  
        And if things went horribly wrong… I could just delete the branch and pretend it never happened.
    </p>
<pre>
# Create and switch to a new branch
git checkout -b feature-branch

# Merge branch into main
git checkout main
git merge feature-branch
</pre>

    <h2>Common Mistakes & Lessons</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Commit often:</strong> Small commits are easier to debug than one giant commit called “fixed stuff”.</li>
        <li><strong>Read error messages:</strong> Git’s errors are like riddles — cryptic but solvable.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t fear the terminal:</strong> The CLI is your friend, not your enemy.</li>
        <li><strong>Pull before you push:</strong> Avoid conflicts by syncing with the remote repo first.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Resources I Used</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2" target="_blank">Pro Git Book</a> — Free and super detailed.</li>
        <li><a href="https://learngitbranching.js.org/" target="_blank">Learn Git Branching</a> — Interactive and visual.</li>
        <li><a href="https://docs.github.com/en" target="_blank">GitHub Docs</a> — Everything you need straight from the source.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        Learning Git & GitHub felt intimidating at first, but once I started, I realized it’s less about memorizing 
        commands and more about understanding the workflow. Now, I can’t imagine coding without it.  
        My advice? Just start small, mess around, and don’t be afraid to break things — 
        Git will always have your back.
